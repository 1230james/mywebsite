        <p>&emsp;Welcome to <strong>1230james's Website</strong>! My name is James Hyun, a college undergraduate majoring in computer science who likes to program and do some other niche things.</p>
        <p>This website is intended to serve as an online "portfolio" where I can show off the things I want to share to anyone who passes by, from online acquaintances to potential employers to family members.</p>
        <p>View the links in the navigation bar above to see and learn more about who I am and what I do.</p>
        <p class="textcenter"><em>This website is still a <strong>work-in-progress!</strong></em></p>
